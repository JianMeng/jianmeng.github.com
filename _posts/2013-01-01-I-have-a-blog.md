Today I have a new blog.  Bringing up as a silient good kid, it is very strange for me 
to create a blog to talk.

So why I want to create a blog?
==============================

The reason comes from servial channels.

1. I want to be popular. I am not 12th years old,so put this reason in the first maybe seem
   too naive. But I want to spread my mind to enlight other people in the world to improve our life.

2. I need practice to make my english good. Although my job (as a programmer) lead me to learn a
   lots of languages (C,C++,erlang,java,javascript,python,TCL,etc.) that run on the world, english is
   still my most favority in everyday life. As world became more and more smaller by internet, writing
   is better way to interact with the mass. Although I am a Chinese,I decide to write in English for
   almost foreign people can easily read. And I think writing in english for a blog is very good 
   opportunity and challenge for me. If I am doing mess with something,please let me known. You can found my
   contact info below.

3. I don't want to be limited in 256 bytes. Although the sharing web site like twitter,weibo(Chinese twitter)
   will continue soar, a lot of thoughts can not to correctly convey to reader in just 256 bytes.
   So a blog is much better to do this.

What is this blog about?
========================

1. Collection of ideas,travelling,and beautiful scene.
   I will do marketing for xi'an,my hometown,a city being full of lovely people. 

2. Spreading knowledge.
   Computer tech is a big topic in this blogs.That is where my passion in.
