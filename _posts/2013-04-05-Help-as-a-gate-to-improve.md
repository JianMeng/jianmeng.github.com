The user centered design(UCD) in today try his best to make us believe that 
a website should have help system as little as possible. It seem not very 
clear point. But it is true, because user need to read the help system embeded
 in web app. User is alway in hurry. They want their jobs "done", but your help
system is an obvious cost to finish their work. So they frown on your help 
system. It's clear your help system should as clear and short as possible to 
make your customer happy.


What about we just cut off help system in website? 
But you must have a place to make user to know how to do it. The help system is
 ideal place to hold this content. So you can't just delete it from your 
website, you can only make it short.


But how to make it shorter? A ideal way to do this is to only answer the question
your user asked. After all, your website isn't wikipedia. So what question user
 will ask? I don't know. But your can add a search function to your help system.
When your customer does not find they answer in your help system, you can send
the term user inputed back to web server. The time to improve has come.

It is what I called help is a gate to improve.
