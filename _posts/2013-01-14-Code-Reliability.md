Code reliability often means burning the midnight oil for a engineer who is
programming for serious problem. A more interesting expression for this issue is

Here is a story about reliability extracted from Kaifu Lee's Book -- 
[Making A World Of Difference](http://kaifulee.diandian.com/post/2011-11-28/7231321).

> Before we flew to New York, I cautioned Sculley that our system was new and hadn’t
> been perfected. It would look really bad if Casper suddenly died on the air. Then
> Sculley asked me, “How likely would that happen?” 
>
>
> I said, “About 10%.”
>
>
> Sculley asked, “Would it be possible to lower the failure rate to 1%?”
>
>
> I thought about it for a couple of minutes, and then replied, “OK, John, I’ll give
> it a try.”

> Later, Sculley asked me, “How did you lower the failure rate to 1%?”

> I replied, “I brought two computers and connected them. Had the first one gone down,
> the second one would have taken its place. Because a computer’s failure rate is 10%.
> The failure rate of both is 10% X 10% =1%. So our success rate was 99%!”

In this time, the show get its reliability by adding a machine.
